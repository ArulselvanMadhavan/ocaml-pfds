* Introduction
** Why StandardML
   - strict
   - module system for describing abstract data types
** Func vs Imperative
   - Destructive updates(assignments)
     - Not allowed in func lang
   - Need for persistence
** Strict vs Lazy Evaluation
   - Strict for reasoning about asymptotic complexity
   - Strict languages can describe worst case data structures but not
     amortized ones
   - Lazy langs can describe amortized data structures but not worst
     case ones
